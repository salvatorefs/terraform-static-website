##  Project Overview

This project uses **Terraform** to deploy a **static website** on **AWS S3**.  
After applying the infrastructure, the website becomes publicly accessible through the S3 bucket endpoint.

---

## Project Structure

- `index.html` â€“ The main static webpage
- `main.tf` â€“ Defines the S3 bucket, permissions, and website configuration
- `outputs.tf` â€“ Outputs the website URL
- `variables.tf` â€“ Stores variable definitions
- (Optional) `error.html` â€“ Error page for the website

---

##  What This Project Does

- Creates a secure S3 bucket configured for static website hosting
- Sets public access policies
- Uploads an index page (`index.html`)
- Outputs the website endpoint URL
- Uses best Terraform practices (separate `.tf` files)
